Static Pages
=====

Static Pages is a rails engine to serve static content from app/views/pages.

Files are displayed following this (named) route:

  map.page "/pages/:id", :controller => :pages, :action => :show

where :id is the name of the file (think template names).

Example
=======

  rails g page imprint

Creates imprint.html.erb in app/views/pages with this content:

  This page can be found in app/views/pages/imprint.html.erb.

The page can be retrieved by pointing the browser to:
  localhost:3000/pages/imprint
